                <h3>Legendary Places in the Magical Universe</h3>
                <p>
                The wizarding world, also referred to as the magical community, 
                was the society in which wizards and witches lived and interacted, 
                separate from non-wizarding society. The two communities were kept separate 
                through the use of charms, spells, and secrecy. Wizards were 
                forbidden to reveal anything about magic to Muggle society due to 
                the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.
                </p>
                <p>
                Each country had a form of wizarding government to oversee magical affairs in their territory, 
                such as a Ministry of Magic or a Council of Magic. The International Confederation of Wizards served 
                as a wizarding intergovernmental organisation.
                Magic was honed through study, training and formal schooling, 
                but could not be simply learnt by Muggles. Non-magic skills, 
                such as picking a lock with a hairpin rather than an Unlocking Charm, 
                were uncommon to the point of novel rarity.[1] Magic was used for mostly everything, 
                including cooking, cleaning, travelling, communicating, child rearing and medical treatment.

                        In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, 
                        just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, 
                        and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort....

                        Hermione Granger was an English Muggle-born witch born to Mr and Mrs Granger.
                        At the age of eleven, she learned about her magical nature and was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                        Hermione began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House.

                        Because that's what Hermione does. When in doubt, go to the library.
                        Hermione first met her future best friends Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express, 
                        and initially they found her unfriendly and somewhat of an "insufferable know-it-all", 
                        an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors.

                        Ronald Weasley ("Ron") was an English pure-blood wizard, 
                        the sixth and youngest son of Arthur and Molly Weasley. 
                        He was also the younger brother of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, and the elder brother of Ginny.
                        Ron and his siblings lived at The Burrow, on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole, Devon.

                        I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. 
                        You could say I got a lot to live up to. 
                        Bill and Charlie have already left â€” Bill was Head Boy and 
                        Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. 
                        Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. 
                        Everyone expects me to do.....
