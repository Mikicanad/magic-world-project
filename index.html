                <p>
                The wizarding world, also referred to as the magical community, 
                was the society in which wizards and witches lived and interacted, 
                separate from non-wizarding society. The two communities were kept separate 
                through the use of charms, spells, and secrecy. Wizards were 
                forbidden to reveal anything about magic to Muggle society due to 
                the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.
                </p>
                <p>
                Each country had a form of wizarding government to oversee magical affairs in their territory, 
                such as a Ministry of Magic or a Council of Magic. The International Confederation of Wizards served 
                as a wizarding intergovernmental organisation.
                Magic was honed through study, training and formal schooling, 
                but could not be simply learnt by Muggles. Non-magic skills, 
                such as picking a lock with a hairpin rather than an Unlocking Charm, 
                were uncommon to the point of novel rarity.[1] Magic was used for mostly everything, 
                including cooking, cleaning, travelling, communicating, child rearing and medical treatment.
